### Next Episode ###

A menu item (Play Next Episode) that plays the next episode based on the currently playing file was added in previous build and was bound to âŒ˜E. This works for most formats of naming including

    File Name 01
    File_Name_1
    File Name Episode 1

This build added an extra option to play the next episode automatically, saving the user  from clicking on the `Play Next Episode` menu item each time.
